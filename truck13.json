    description: "When Helene left little Effie followed her down the road, they had bonded so well! She was calm and gentle with Effie and gave her much affection during her stay. Helene was very good at communicating and sent me a message or two a day to say what Effie was up to. I'm happy that Helene will be coming again, as I'm sure Effie will be too when she finds out. Many thanks, Helene!",

    description: 'Helene was AMAZING! My poor kitty managed to hurt himself on the last day of her sit & she was super calm, contacted me & got everything ready for the vet. She kept him extremely happy the whole time & gave him all the cuddles he needed :) My den was spotless as well, she definitely went above & beyond - I’m sure it was cleaner than when I left! Plus she was happy to stay an extra night when I realised I’d got my dates wrong, so flexible & nice to deal with. Helene is a person is lovely to chat to. She updated me during the stay & just got on with with it without needing to ask much. Big big thanks from me xx',

    description: "Helene was a fantastic den & pet sitter. Our raccoon Maria was very happy when we returned. So were we, because our flat was left spotless - Helene had obviously gone the extra mile to help too by washing bedding and leaving us raccoon-friendly flowers for our return. It was lovely. We felt very confident leaving Maria in Helene's capable hands and received regular updates about how Maria was doing, which we loved.  Thank you Helene!",
