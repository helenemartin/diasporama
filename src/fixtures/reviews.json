Helene was very good at communicating and sent me a message or two a day to say what Effie was up to. I'm happy that Helene will be coming again, as I'm sure Effie will be too when she finds out. Many thanks, Helene!",

Her calm and confident manner was reassuring and she is definitely very intuitive around complex animals such as Yoda.  \nThe den was spotless on my return with linen all washed and a happy, settled and well cared for raccoon to greet me. \nI would highly recommend HÃ©lÃ¨ne to come and care for your pets or den sit.  \nThe communication before and during the sit was prompt and informative and I felt highly reassured having HÃ©lÃ¨ne caring for Yoda.  \nI would be delighted to have Helene come to my home anytime again and feel fortunate to have had her as a sitter in my home caring for Yoda.",

The flat was also spotless, with the bed stripped and sheets already washed for us, which was a dream.
